## Explanation of Design Patterns

### Dependency Injection
- Heavily used in various entities such as:
  - LetterRack
  - GameState
  - Various Use Case Interactors
  - Controller
- Main reason for use is to:
  - ensure the same objects are being referenced from different entities
    - Using aliasing to simulate real such tiles out of a bag that everyone shares
  - If dependent on an interface, then ensure the interfaces can always be used regardless of impletmentation
  - Easily extended and sometimes required depending on entity
    - Follows Open-Close principle
    - Off loads work mostly to main which is responsible for instantiation anyways (follows single responsibility principle)

### Factory 
- Used in BoardFactory, explained in the BoardFactory Interface
- Complies with the Open/Closed Principle of SOLID
- This design pattern could easily be extended to the other entities (i.e. Player, Bag, etc.)

### Facade
- Used in PlaceWordRefillInteractor, further explained in detail in its JavaDoc
- Complies with Open/Closed and Single Responsibility principle's of SOLID
## Overall Structure - What is in each layer and how the flow of control works

### Enterprise Business Rules (Entities)
- **Bag**
  - Represents the bag of letters of the game. Contains an ArrayList of Tile objects which can be taken out and added as needed.
- **Tile**
  - Represents a letter that can be used in the game. Contains a char representation of the letter, and the value of that letter.
- **Square**
  - Represents a spot on the grid of the board. Contains the Tile it is holding (or null) and the multiplier corresponding to this spot.
- **LetterRack**
  - Represents the letters a player has. Contains a reference to the Bag, a list of the Tile objects, and an integer representing its length.
- **Coordinate**
  - Represents a spot on the location on the grid of the board. Contains integers for the x-coordinate and y-coordinate.
- **GameState**

- **DefaultBoard**

- **Dictionary**
